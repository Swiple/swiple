title: How to schedule validations
---
Schedules allow you to run data validations on a specific date or at certain time intervals. You can create a schedule by using one of the schedule types. `Date`, `Interval` or `Cron`.

### When to use which schedule type?

#### Date
The date schedule type should be used to validate data once on a specific date and time. For example, `2022-10-01 8:00:00`

#### Interval
The interval schedule type should be used to validate data on some fixed period of time. For example, every 15 minutes, every 6 hours, every week.

#### Cron
Cron offers detailed schedule control. For example, run Monday - Friday at 8am or run every 2 hours Monday - Friday between 8am and 5pm.
