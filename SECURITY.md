# Security Policy
If you believe you have identified a security issue, **DO NOT** open a public issue. To responsibly report a security issue, please email security@swiple.io. A security team member will contact you acknowledging the report and how to continue.

Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting normal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address the issue faster. If you are able, you may also include a fix for the issue.

## Supported Versions
The current and previous release will receive security patches, with older versions evaluated based on usage information and severity.

After fixing an issue, we will make a security release along with an announcement. You may include a name and link if you would like to be credited for the report.
